This then was the Un-Dead
home of the King-Vampire, to
whom so many more were
due. Its emptiness spoke eloquent
to make certain what I
knew. Before I began to
restore these women to their
dead selves through my awful
work, I laid in Dracula’s
tomb some of the Wafer,
and so banished him from
it, Un-Dead, for ever.
