Shortly before ten o’clock the
stillness of the air grew
quite oppressive, and the silence
was so marked that the
bleating of a sheep inland
or the barking of a dog
in the town was distinctly
heard, and the band on
the pier, with its lively
French air, was like a discord
in the great harmony of
nature’s silence. A little after
midnight came a strange sound
from over the sea, and
high overhead the air began
to carry a strange, faint,
hollow booming.
