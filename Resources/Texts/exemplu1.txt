In certain of the sandstones.
Shortly before ten oclock the
stillness of the air grew
quite oppressive, and the silence
was so marked that the
bleating of a sheep inland
or the barking of a dog
in the town was distinctly
heard, and the band on
the pier, with its lively;
French air, was like a discord
in the great harmony of
nature's silence. A little after
midnight came a strange sound
from over the sea, and
high overhead the air began
to carry a strange, faint,
hollow booming.
12 September - How good
they all are to me.
I quite love that dear
Dr. Van Helsing. I wonder
why he was so anxious about
these flowers. He positively frightened
me, he was so fierce.
And yet he must have
been right, for I feel
comfort from them already. Somehow,
I do not dread being
alone to-night, and I can
go to sleep without fear.
I shall not mind any
flapping outside the window. Oh,
the terrible struggle that I have
had against sleep so often
of late; the pain of
the sleeplessness, or the pain
of the fear of sleep,
with such unknown horrors as
it has for me! How
blessed are some people, whose
lives have no fears, no
dreads; to whom sleep is
a blessing that comes nightly,
and brings nothing but sweet
dreams. Well, here I am
to-night, hoping for sleep, and
lying like Ophelia in the
play, with virgin crants and
maiden strewments. I never liked
garlic before, but to-night it
is delightful! There is peace
in its smell; I feel
sleep coming already. Good-night, everybody.
